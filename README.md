# Hot_Stocks

Hey there! You have stumbled upon the student project "Hot Stocks", which is part of the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" by Mario Silic (Spring Semester 2021 at the University of St.Gallen).

The end goal of our group project was to create an application with which you can follow a common RSI buy/sell strategy. We limited our scope to the S&P 100 Stocks found on: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_100

If you want to find out more about our project, check out our code and read more below.
